This is a simple application built for the second course in Google's courses on Android Studio!

We learned how to create themes and apply them to an entire app. 

This was made to replicate the scoring of a basketball game.
The score counter goes up based on which button you press.
You can also reset both scores by pressing the reset button on the bottom.
