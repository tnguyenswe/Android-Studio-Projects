# BusinessCard

This is a simple business card design that I made using Android Studio, it was made for the Udacity course made by Google
on Android Studio requires you to create a project of a business card, fake or real!

That course can be found here: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud834

If you run it properly, it should look like the screenshot below!
