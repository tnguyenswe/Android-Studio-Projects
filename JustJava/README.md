# Coffee Ordering Application

This is a simple application built for the second course in Google's courses on Android Studio!

We have a Name field where the user enters their name, 2 check marks for Whipped Cream and Chocolate, as well as the
quantity of coffees ordered.

We have a limit of 1-100 coffees only since ordering more/less is unreasonable.

Once the user presses the order button, we open a new email that has the customer's information!

Below are pictures of the application in use.
