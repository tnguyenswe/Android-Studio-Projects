# Android-Studio-Projects

These are all the projects I made during the Android Studio Nanodegree program on Udacity made by Google! 

The link to the course can be found here: https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803

Every single project will have a README that includes what the app looks like once ran!

Do note: I did not opt to pay for the nanodegree, so the repository may be missing the projects that are to be reviewed by 
the developers who are working with Udacity and Google.
